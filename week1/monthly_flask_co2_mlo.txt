The data file below contains 10 columns.  Columns 1-4 give the dates in several redundant 
formats. Column 5 below gives monthly CO2 concentrations in micro-mol CO2 per mole (ppm)  
reported on the 2012 SIO manometric mole fraction scale.  This is the standard           
version of the data most often sought.  The monthly values have been adjusted             
to 24:00 hours on the 15th of each month.  Column 6 gives the same data after a seasonal  
adjustment to remove the quasi-regular seasonal cycle.  The adjustment involves           
subtracting from the data a 4-harmonic fit with a linear gain factor.  Column 7 is a      
smoothed version of the data generated from a stiff cubic spline function plus 4-harmonic 
functions with linear gain.  Column 8 is the same smoothed version with the seasonal      
cycle removed.  Column 9 is identical to Column 5 except that the missing values from     
Column 5 have been filled with values from Column 7.  Column 10 is identical to Column 6  
except missing values have been filled with values from Column 8.  Missing values are     
denoted by -99.99
